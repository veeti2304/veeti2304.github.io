## What is this page?

This page contains both external and internal links to various resources I've used / made, download links and so on.

### Note

I will be posting the files that are the proper size to something like catbox.moe instead of my Git repo.<br>
Due to my understanding, it's a somewhat anonymous file host so, if you worry about privacy it should all be good.
