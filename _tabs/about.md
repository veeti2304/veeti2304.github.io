I am a third-year software development student with skills in various programming languages such as C#, PHP, Python, and JavaScript. My proficiency varies between these languages, with some being stronger than others.<br>

I am currently studying this field at the Gradia vocational school in Jyväskylä, Finland.<br>

I specialize in desktop software development (.NET), graphical, console-based and sometimes even making some class libs. However, I also have some experience in web development (PHP, HTML and CSS [I have personal beef with JS]).<br>

I mostly write my articles in Finnish as it is my native language, but if you have questions you can send me an email in English and I will reply back to you in English. (Some of my articles may also be in English).<br>

My resume (in Finnish) can be found here: [Resume (PDF)](https://github.com/veeti2304/veeti2304.github.io/blob/main/_files/CV.pdf)
